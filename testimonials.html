          <p>"Working with Craig has been a great experience. The whole vibe in his studio is just so relaxed and conducive to creating music.  The fact that Craig is not only a producer, but also a musician, is what makes working with him even better.  He not only made my songs sound great, but he added more textures to the songs to bring them to a new level.  He has great sensibilities when it comes to music and understands what makes a song good."</p>

          <p>"Craig is the kind of person who strikes that incredible balance between support and challenge as a friend.  Luckily, he is also recording my music!  I have never felt more confident in my sound, or in my ability to create and change as an artist.  His experience with his trade is unlike anything else I've experienced, and his love and enthusiasm for the history and future of music is contagious and eye-opening."</p>
