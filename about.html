            <h2 class="subtitle">My Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="p-pad">I make music in the following genres: acoustic, electronic, hard rock, hip hop (sampled and live), disco, soul, metal, dance, world…and sometimes all jammed together in one song! I’m interested in breaking new ground and bringing out the unique qualities in all my artists, so I ultimately prefer to blur the genres and not follow trends. I've spent my whole life being obsessed by music of all genres so I feel comfortable doing it all (there are no “guilty pleasures” here), and I always make sure to keep my studio conducive to creating and experimenting.</p>

            <p class="p-pad">I'm a producer but I'm also an artist: I produced, wrote, sung and played everything on my songs, from acoustic/electric guitars, bass, keyboards to programming the drums. I like to make the songs feel like an actual performance, right down to programming different drum parts and fills for each section.  You can also bring your own instrumentals to just record vocals or bring tracks from other recording sessions.</p>
