          <h2 class="subtitle">My Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="p-pad">I make music in the following genres: acoustic, electronic, hard rock, hip hop (sampled and live), disco, soul, metal, dance, world…and sometimes all jammed together in one song! I’m interested in breaking new ground and bringing out the unique qualities in all my artists, so I ultimately prefer to blur the genres and not follow trends. I've spent my whole life being obsessed by music of all genres so I feel comfortable doing it all (there are no “guilty pleasures” here), and I always make sure to keep my studio conducive to creating and experimenting.</p>

          <p class="p-pad">I'm a producer but I'm also an artist: I produced, wrote, sung and played everything on my songs, from acoustic/electric guitars, bass, keyboards to programming the drums. I like to make the songs feel like an actual performance, right down to programming different drum parts and fills for each section.  You can also bring your own instrumentals to just record vocals or bring tracks from other recording sessions.</p>

          <p class="p-pad">Even if you only sing, bring your lyrics and we'll work together to create the melody and music - just your voice and me on acoustic guitar or piano: once the foundation is down, we can build... or keep it sparse: to me it’s all about what’s best for the song. Everything I do is a collaboration, whether I’m playing the instrument or not, so I don’t do anything without my artists here giving their input/approval every step of the way. I'm an artist too, so I've had my own recording nightmares in the past with slow and unsatisfying experiences.  I'm also glad to answer any questions about the recording process.</p>
