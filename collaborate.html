        <!-- <h2 class="subtitle">The Process</h2>
        <p class="p-pad large">Even if you only sing, bring your lyrics and we'll work together to create the melody and music - just your voice and me on acoustic guitar or piano: once the foundation is down, we can build... or keep it sparse: to me it’s all about what’s best for the song. Everything I do is a collaboration, whether I’m playing the instrument or not, so I don’t do anything without my artists here giving their input/approval every step of the way. I'm an artist too, so I've had my own recording nightmares in the past with slow and unsatisfying experiences.  I'm also glad to answer any questions about the recording process.</p>

        <p class="p-pad large">I do this full time, 7 days a week, so as long as you book a few weeks in advance you can get any slot you’d like, but feel free to get in touch to come chill and check out the place first:  I don’t charge for the "hang session".</p> -->

        <h2 class="subtitle">Collaboration</h2>
        <p class="p-pad">I have new school gear and software but old school production sensibilities so I’m interested in more than just setting up the mics and recording. I like to spend some time discussing what you hear in your head and/or your ideal sound and we will make that happen...but there’s no need for a fully realized "grand plan" either! By getting to know you and the music you love I can craft music that "fits" you, in any genre. It’s always completely collaborative, loose and fun.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle top-space">Gear List</h2>

        <p class="p-pad">I also have a wide variety of instruments (which artists are always welcome to use) and software to make your work stand out.  Check out my gear list, I only pick things that I'd love to use myself as an artist!</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Client Testimonials</h2>
        <p class="p-pad">I’m humbled to have artists who come regularly from as far away as the upper parts of Manhattan, New Jersey, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island - even Philly and D.C... and then I have some who walk here from down the street!</p>

        <p class="p-pad">I proudly have artists that I work with week after week and many would be happy to give me a reference – feel free to email any of the artists that I've had the pleasure of working with.</p>
